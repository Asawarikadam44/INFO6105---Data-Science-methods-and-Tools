1.ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection:

In this assignment, I have used Rainfall dataset for predictive learned and checked the quality of the data and determined which features are important.

2.AutoML:

In this assignment, I have used an AutoML library like H2O.ai to create predictive models and interpret them. Found a significant relation for each algorithm for choosing in your data. Created multivariate models.

3.Model Interpretablity:

In this assignment, fit a linear model and interpret the regression coefficients. 
Fit a tree-based model and interpret the nodes
Used auto ml to find the best model
Run SHAP analysis on the models from steps 1, 2, and 3,   interpret the SHAP values and compare them with the other model interpretability methods.
